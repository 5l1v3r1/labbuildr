install-scaleiosvm installs a 3-Node ScaleIO Cluster based upon the ScaleIO VMware Storage Virtual Machine ( SVM ).  
the process is devided in 2 steps:
* [import](http://labbuildr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Solutionpacks//install-scaleiosvm.ps1#import)
* [install](http://labbuildr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Solutionpacks//install-scaleiosvm.ps1#install)

## import  

we import the SVM with 
```Powershell
.\install-scaleiosvm.ps1 -import
```
labbuildr will select the sourcedir from defaults as well as the master directory  
if no svm to import is found, you will be asked fro download ( can be surpressed with -confirm:$false )

during the import, you may see some warnings from the ova tool, you can just ignore them. 
when the import is successfull, the command for creating a default ScaleIO Cluster  is presented:

## install 
the installaion is started with 
```Powershell
.\install-scaleiosvm.ps1 -ScaleIOMaster C:\SharedMaster\ScaleIOVM_2nics_2.0.6035.0
```
labbuildr will first will check for the specified master and cerate a base snapshot.
after the basesnapshot is done, 3 VMÂ´s are cerated, and each get a default of 3 additional diskdrives

in the node configuration sequence, labbuildr will show the commands issued to the nodes for base configuration and scaleio software installation
