## multi-host configuratioins
labbuildr allows for multi-host configurations. to be able to connect virtual machines on different hosts via network, 
the use of vlanÂ´s is required. 

a standard, distributed labs use 802.1Q VLANS.
I recommend TPLink or Netgear SoHo switches ( EG, TP-Link TL-SG108, Netgear GS-108GE, TP-Link Archer C7 w. OpenWRTR )
Therefore, some requirements ion the hosts must be met:
For windows Hosts, it is best using Intel ANS Drivers with VLAN SUpport ( Attention, on Windows 10 only Anniversary Update currently ! )
For Linux, use default VLAN SUpport ( Ubuntu witr Netrwork Manager )
For OSX, Default VLAN COnfig.

Internet Connection is done Via OpenWRT ( Physically or VM )


## Example 1
In This Example, i create a VLAN VLAN3 , and the Virtual machine should use VMnet3.
The Subnet to be used is 10.10.3.0
OpenWRT runs as a VM on Host1

on Host1
```Powershell
Set-LABsubnet -subnet 10.10.3.0
Set-LABDNS -DNS1 10.10.3.10 -DNS2 10.10.3.4 
Set-LABvmnet vmnet3
Set-LabDefaultGateway 10.0.3.4
```
